# Refresh all materialized views.

# Materialized views are used to access folders, metadatatypes, metafields, etc.
# The data is extracted from the nodes table for performance reasons.
# Refreshing should be done whenever relevant changes should be visible on the API.
# May also be called periodically (e.g. hourly or daily).
